        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
